React app for the nu world cup website!

Things to do: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Homepage - stuff needs to be vertically centred, add carousel and sponsor info
- Gallery page rework, Contact page should be an exec page
- Make sure everything is responsive

Lower priority:
- Images on AWS, for now can make the files smaller
=======
- Import homepage from Angel's code/transparent background logo with homepage
- Gallery page rework
- About page rework
- Space below the footer argh
- Clean up the CSS so we're not breaking our necks finding shit


Nice to have:
